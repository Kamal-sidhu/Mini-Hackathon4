# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive registration form created for Module 04: Mini Hackathon (Interactive Form with Validation).  
The goal of the project is to build a user-friendly form that applies HTML5 form concepts, built-in validation, JavaScript event handling, and custom validation rules.  
The form collects user details, preferences, and agreement confirmation, and includes real-time error messages and accessibility considerations.
